Twitter bot that creates a Markov chain from Thus Spake Zarathustra and
generates random strings every 15 minutes.

To run, get the code
	go get github.com/kevindkeogh/zarathustrov
change the working directory
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kevindkeogh/zarathustrov

There you'll need to create a Twitter app and update the secrets.go file
with the necessary credentials. Then you can build the app
	make build

You can run the app with just
	./bin/zarathustrov
or you can run it as a service.
	cp zarathustrov.service /etc/systemd/system/
	systemctl reload-daemon
	systemctl enable zarathustrov.service
	systemctl start zarathustrov.service

And then you're done!
